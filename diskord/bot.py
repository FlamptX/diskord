class Bot(Client):
    """Represents a bot that interacts with Discord API.

    This inherits from :class:`Client` so anything that is valid there is also valid
    there.

    The purpose of this class is to aid in creation of application commands and other
    features that are not compatible in :class:`Client`. It is highly recommended
    to use this class instead of :class:`Client` if you aim to use application commands
    like slash commands, user & message commands etc.

    All the parameters from :class:`Client` can be passed in this class and
    all attributes and methods are valid too.

    These parameters are those that can only be passed this class.

    Parameters
